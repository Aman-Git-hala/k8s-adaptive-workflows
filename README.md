# k8s-adaptive-workflows
Designing a distributed workflow system that executes DAG based tasks on Kubernetes and adapts to real-world uncertainty such as task failures, variable execution times, and dynamic resource availability. The core of the system is an adaptive scheduler that uses probabilistic modeling, runtime metrics, and ML based prediction.
